</h1>
                    
					<p> I will walk you through the process of creating a "Snake" game from scratch using <a href="https://gptchatly.com/ChatGPT4-no-login.html">ChatGPT-4</a>, a cutting-edge AI language model developed by <a href="openai.com">OpenAI</a>. I will provide valuable insights and commentary throughout the development process, and by the end of this article, you will have access to the complete game code for your reference. Don't miss out on this opportunity to learn from the best and develop your own version of this classic game!</p>

                  <p>I found myself with a burning curiosity: could the GPT-4 model autonomously craft a game, completely from scratch, without any coding assistance whatsoever? My only role was to provide the game's performance feedback, all while operating PyCharm from JetBrains to execute the scripts. </p>

<p>And so, the game was set to appear in the "Pygame" window. With bated breath, I watched as GPT-4 began to churn out lines of code. The first version was completed in what seemed like a matter of moments. Alas, it was all for naught; the "Pygame" window closed immediately, accompanied by a discouraging "Process finished with exit code 0" message. </p>

 <p>I reported this to ChatGPT. Unsurprisingly, GPT-4 offered a congratulatory response, mistakingly believing that the game had indeed run successfully. However, I had to clarify that the "Pygame" window had closed immediately, leaving the model with yet another challenge to overcome.</p>

<p>The GPT-4 attempted to produce another version of the game, but it failed to run. After being suggested to update the 'game_over' function, I did so, and the Pygame window remained, displaying only the "Game Over" message without any actual gameplay.



<p>Below is the code for the updated snake game, written entirely by <a href="https://gptchatly.com/ChatGPT4-no-login.html">ChatGPT-4</a>:</p>
