	In a bold move to protect the rights of artists and music labels, the global music industry has launched a website aimed at combatting the unauthorized use of their work by technology companies to train artificial intelligence models. The initiative, led by the International Confederation of Music Publishers (ICMP), represents a significant step forward in the industry's battle against AI companies that have been illegally accessing and mining musicians' content.
<br>
<br>The new website, RightsAndAI.com, serves as a platform for music labels to protect their copyright and warn tech businesses about the consequences of using or distributing their work without permission. The ICMP, which represents about 90% of the world's commercially released music, has taken action in response to the growing number of AI companies that have been trawling through music content without proper authorization.
<br>
<br>According to the ICMP, AI is not a new concept for the music industry, but the recent surge of AI companies that have been illegally accessing and using musicians' work has prompted the industry to take action. The music industry's efforts to protect artists' rights come amidst growing concerns about the use of AI in the creative industries.
<br>
<br>Earlier this year, musician Elvis Costello was among the signatories of a letter coordinated by the Artists Rights Alliance, calling on AI companies to respect copyright laws and the rights of artists. The letter, which was signed by over 180 artists and industry professionals, urged AI companies to obtain proper licenses and permissions before using musicians' work.
<br>
<br>The music industry's efforts to combat the unauthorized use of AI have been met with support from the UK government. In a recent op-ed, music industry expert Simon Goodbody called on the UK government to provide urgent guidance on AI training rules and ensure that musicians' rights are protected.
<br>
<br>The launch of RightsAndAI.com is a significant milestone in the music industry's battle against AI companies that have been using musicians' work without permission. The website serves as a platform for music labels to protect their copyright and send a clear message to tech companies that the unauthorized use of musicians' work will not be tolerated.
<br>
<br>The music industry's efforts to protect artists' rights come at a critical time, as AI continues to play an increasingly important role in the creative industries. As AI technology continues to evolve, it is essential that musicians' rights are protected, and the music industry's initiative to combat the unauthorized use of AI is a step in the right direction.
