                  <p>ABOUT UK-HDAN</p>
<p>The UK Health Data Analytics Network (UK-HDAN) is a broad community of over 400 health data scientists across the UK that will work together to map the UK health data analytics landscape and to frame the national strategy for health data analytics research. The network is being established with support from EPSRC. Our core community will be health informatics researchers and basic data scientists embedded in a healthcare setting so we are keen to engage with researchers who are involved in health data analytics and/or health informatics and also interested data scientists who may had little exposure so far to applying their research in the health and social care domain.</p>

<p>Working in collaboration with the Farr Institute and the Alan Turing Institute, UK-HDAN will focus on data science to address key challenges in health and social care, bridging the gap between the development of foundational theory, methodologies and algorithms and the use of electronic health records and other population-based data for health research. UK-HDAN is coordinated by Manchester Informatics. </p>

<p>Following further input from the UK-HDAN community, a research roadmap is currently in the process of development. The <a href="https://www.ukhdan.org.uk/media/1997/ukhdan-roadmap-final.pdf">research roadmap</a> is a working document which has been created using output gathered from the Inaugural and Research Roadmap Workshops, the Industry Engagement Workshops and the network Survey. The Roadmap will provide funders, particularly EPSRC, with a clear statement of the research challenges and opportunities within health data analytics, and will provide an important framework from which to continue the dialogue with key stakeholders. </p>
